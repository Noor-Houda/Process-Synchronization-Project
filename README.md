A C console application simulating a simplified airline ticketing system, built to explore process synchronization mechanisms in Linux operating systems.

This project was developed as part of an operating systems course assignment.  

It demonstrates the use of Linux process synchronization primitives to ensure safe and coordinated access to shared resources in a multi-process environment.

The application models a simple airline ticketing scenario where multiple processes (e.g., customers, booking agents) interact with a shared ticket database.
